cats-mtl
==========
Transformer type classes for cats.

Provides transformer type classes for cats' Monads, Applicatives and Functors.

As well, there are some abstractions thrown in that allow you to
generically lift transformer type classes through transformers with the capability.

You can have multiple cats-mtl transformer type classes in scope at once without implicit ambiguity,
unlike in pre-1.0.0 cats or Scalaz 7.
